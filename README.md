## Things I have learned while building with Electron

1. Electron has 2 separate processes one for main and one is a renderer process. Main is based on node dealing with your computer hardware and need to be kept secure, the renderer one is for UI only. You need to debug seaperatly for each one.



In next version I will update with the ability to backup automatically each 5min :).
